# Student Intenship System

The proposed system is to develop a userfriendly web application that students can directly search and apply for internship opportunities. 
The proposed is such that companies, organizations can register and upload internship offers and also the proposed would serve as a portal for the departments. 
This will allow the departments to post news and update students about any internship offer available to students from the departments.
Students need to register and login to have access to apply for internship on the web application. 
Companies on the other hand would have to create an account to upload their openings. 
A student upon seeing a particular internship offer and reading the description and details attached to the message can apply for that opportunity. 
With the proposed system, students are only required to upload a scanned document of their internship letter after filling in their details and then it then sent to the companyâ€™s database. 
Companies/organisations can therefore respond to student application by approving or disapproving their application. 
When the company accepts a particular student application letter for a job, a text message is sent to the student as a feedback stating the acceptance of the letter and when to begin the internship.
